- 👋 Hi, I’m Kohl Schroeder.
- 👀 I’m interested in hosting a website with GitHub Pages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and some basic JS.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on much, as this is just my account for a school project.
- 📫 If you need to contact me, just click [here](mailto:kschroeder@rundlecollege.ca) and your default email client will handle the rest.
